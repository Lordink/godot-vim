## FAQ
1. How to override default Godot shortcuts with `godot-vim`'s ones

    Note that all non-ascii character mappings that are already mapped in the default Godot editor have to be unmapped from the Editor settings (Editor >> Editor Settings >> Shorcuts) before being usable with `godot-vim`.
    
    This currently goes for:
    
    - `Ctrl+R`
    - `Ctrl+U`
    - `Ctrl+D`
    
    See the full list of non-ascii shortucts that may already be mapped by Godot and thus wouldn't work in `godot-vim` before releasing them in Godot settings: https://github.com/wenqiangwang/godot-vim/blob/main/addons/godot-vim/godot-vim.gd#L138

2. I found a problem, what should I do?

   - You could debug by yourself, changing the value of `DEBUGGING` variable to 1 to see logs
   - Or report the issue by providing a) the content of original text editing, b) the cursor position and c) key sequence that repros the issue
